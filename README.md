# OpenNewPOS6
HTML document designed to emulate the McDonalds POS system. A project only for cosmetic perposes. No McDonalds copy right intended.

#Why?
Just thought it might be fun to emulate how the McDoanlds till interface works, maybe educate some of the masses how to properly speak a mcodnalds meal.

#Contributing
Anyone who wishes to contribute needs to fork this project and submit a pull request. So far there is currently no functionality so there is not much to contribute other than interface design.
